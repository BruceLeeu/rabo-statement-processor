# Rabobank Statement Processor

This application is a monorepo that consists of two backend APIs (1. Node.js Express, 2. Kotlin Spring) and a React frontend (with Sass and TypeScript)

## Running the application

Ensure your computer has the following dependencies installed:

- Node (npm) >= 22.19.0 (you can possibly get away with lower versions)
- Java >= 11
- Kotlin >= 2.2.0
- Gradle >= 9.0.0

In each subfolder you will find an appropriate readme that details how to install and run all the individual parts together.

## Goal

The goal of these two applications is to showcase a potential Fullstack solution (Proof of Concept) that processes either CSV or XML files for bank statement validations.
Even though this application is aimed to be as production-ready as possible, the code is delivered as-is and is for demonstration purposes only.
